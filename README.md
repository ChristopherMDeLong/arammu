# Arammu

### Prerequisites:
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ® and an npm package manager.
##### Node.js
Angular requires `Node.js` version 8.x or 10.x.
To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
If you do not have Node.js click [here](nodejs.org) to install it.

##### npm package manager
Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as [npm packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/index.html). To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.

This project uses the [npm client](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) command line interface, which is installed with `Node.js` by default.
To check that you have the npm client installed, run `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.

Once you have the npm client installed, in any directory run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to globally install the Angular CLI.

### Steps to locally run this project:
1. Clone this repo to your local computer.
2. Open your terminal and `cd   ` into the directory and run `npm install`. This should install all local dependecies to the project into the  `node_modules` folder.
3. Run `ng serve --open`. This should start the Angular server and open your browser to localhost:4200 where the project should be visible. Once you edit and hit save to a file within the project, the browser should automatically refresh with your changes.

If you recieve an error or you were unable to locally serve this project PLEASE contact me instead of spending hours trying to solve it yourself. There is no point in spending unnecessary time trying to figure out how to get Angular running instead of actually working on the project.

You may email as many questions/tips/advice as you like and I will try my best to reply promptly. 

I have finished the home page as an example for what we are looking for so feel free to look at that as an example. The home page code is located [here](src/app/home). Please do not change the header or footer components as they are complete as well.

You will be given specific pages from the [Arammu](https://www.arammu.org) site to copy over to this Angular project. Please DO NOT simply copy all the source code from the original site onto here. You must create your own CSS classes and HTML structure. You can look at the source code for a starting point and ideas, but do not simply copy it over. We are using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/) as our main framework for the UI so feel free to utilize any of its components. You are free to include new Frameworks or Platforms for the UI also, please just run it by me before implementing it.
